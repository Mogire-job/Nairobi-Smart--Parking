# Next.js Project README

Welcome to your Next.js project! This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), providing a robust foundation for building modern, high-performance web applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start developing locally, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view your application.

You can begin editing the main page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you save changes.
